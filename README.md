# 3JS Portfolio Experimentation

This repository contains my experiments with the [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) library as I worked on developing my portfolio website. Throughout this journey, I explored various concepts and tools, including [React-Three-Fiber](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/getting-started/introduction) and [drei](https://github.com/pmndrs/drei), which helped me enhance my understanding and skills in 3D rendering within a React environment.

## Repository Structure

The repo is organized into multiple folders, each containing multiple `index.js` and `main.js` files that showcases different stages of my progress. These stages reflect my learning curve as I experimented with various features and techniques in 3JS.

## Final Portfolio

The culmination of this experimentation is my final portfolio website, which can be found in a separate repository: [TarushGupta Portfolio](https://github.com/TarushGupta23/TarushGupta).

Feel free to explore the code, and if you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to open an issue or a pull request. 

## Technologies Used

- **Three.js**: A JavaScript 3D library for creating 3D graphics in the browser.
- **React-Three-Fiber**: A React renderer for Three.js.
- **drei**: A growing collection of useful helpers for react-three-fiber.

## Learnings

Through this project, I gained valuable insights into:

- Creating and manipulating 3D objects using Three.js.
- Integrating 3D rendering into a React application with react-three-fiber.
- Utilizing drei for enhancing 3D scenes with additional features and components.
